        <p>
          I am a passionate and dedicated software developer with a proven track
          record of creating high-quality, innovative solutions. With{" "}
          {calculateAge()} of experience in the industry, I have honed my skills
          in environments NodeJs and Dotnet. My expertise extends across web
          development and mobile applications.

        <h1 className="text-center text-lg font-bold">How I started</h1>
        <p>
          My first contact with programming was when I was 14 years old while
          playing on my father&apos;s computer. I noticed that if I changed some
          values in a certain file, some changes occurred within the game.
          <br />
          <br />
          At the age of 17, I entered the State University of Amazonas, where I
          learned to program in Python and had a brief introduction to
          artificial intelligence.
          <br />
          <br />
          In 2021 I started studying at Trybe, where I learned about web
          development, covering frontend, backend and database, while improving
          my theoretical knowledge at the Federal Technological University of
          Paran√°
